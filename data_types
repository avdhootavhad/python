#Data types in python
#1. List its ordered and mutable we can change the data or we can add element into that
a = [5,6,4,7,]
a.append(21)
# set unordered and data will not change
b = {1,2,3,4,5,6,}
# tuple it is unordered and data will not change
c =(1,2,3,4,5,6,)
# Dictionary unordered and changable
d = {"Name ": "Avdhoot","Age":"21","Branch":"Electrical"}
d.update({"Name":"sujit"})
print(a,b,c,d)
# we can update the data in dictionary using update command and you can also  we can add element in list only
